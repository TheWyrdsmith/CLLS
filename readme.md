# Closed Loop Life Support

## Introduction

*Closed Loop Life Support* (or CLLS) is a simple life support mod for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com), providing the necessary parts and resources to to simulate life support consumption and production during long voyages through space.

Features:
+ Kerbals will require a new resource "LifeSupport" while not on Kerbin (1 unit per day).
+ All parts with crew capacity will hold a small amount of "LifeSupport" (3 units per crew-slot).
+ Kerbals on EVA will take 1 unit of "LifeSupport" from the ship and put it back once they return.
+ Kerbals which have run out of life support will go into hibernation (they will turn into completely passive passengers) and will only wake up again once life support has been restored or the vessel has been recovered (rookies will die though).
+ Kerbals on EVA which have run out of life support will die.
+ Life support can be extended with life support storage containers.
+ For longer missions life support generators can be used to generate life support (the idea is that air, water, and bio-waste is recycled b using algae and other micro organisms). This allows the creation of fully self-sufficient interplanetary ships and bases.
+ The life support usage and production of kerbals and ships is tracked for all ships, even in the background.

TODO:
+ Replace stock models of the new parts with real models.
